# Callosum Privacy Policy

**Last Updated:** September 8, 2025

## 1. Introduction

Callosum ("we", "our", or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use our browser extension (the "Extension").

## 2. Data Collection and Use

### No Data Collection

We do not collect, store, or transmit any of your personal data, browsing history, or content you interact with through the Extension. All processing happens locally on your device.

### Local Storage

The Extension uses the browser's local storage to store:
- Your preferences and settings
- Chat history (stored locally on your device)
- Extension configuration

This data never leaves your device and is not accessible by us or any third parties.

## 3. Ollama Integration

The Extension communicates with a locally running instance of Ollama that you control. All interactions with Ollama:
- Occur directly between your browser and your local Ollama server
- Are not intercepted, stored, or monitored by us
- Are subject to the privacy policy of your local Ollama installation

## 4. Permissions

The Extension requests the following browser permissions:

- **activeTab**: To access the current tab's content when you explicitly interact with the Extension
- **storage**: To save your preferences and chat history locally
- **scripting**: To inject content scripts for text selection and interaction
- **contextMenus**: To add options to the right-click context menu

## 5. Data Security

Since all data processing happens locally on your device:
- Your data never leaves your machine
- No internet connection is required (except for Ollama model downloads)
- You maintain full control over your data

## 6. Changes to This Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last Updated" date.
